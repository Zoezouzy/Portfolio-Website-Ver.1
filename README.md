# Portfolio-Website-Ver.1
- A simple portfolio website for myself.
- This is my first time coding with actual project. Wanna start from here to learn frontend coding.

- First we need to prepare a picture as 'main.jpg'
- Then we start with an index.html
- For the style of the page, we create a style.css
- Voila!
